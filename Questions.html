In\r\nbacktracking, we search depth-first for solutions, backtracking to the last\r\nvalid path as soon as we hit a dead end.\r\n\r\nBacktracking reduces the search space since we no longer have to follow down any\r\npaths we know are invalid. This is called pruning. We must be able to test\r\npartial solutions: for example, we can't find a global optimum using\r\nbacktracking, since we have no idea if the solution we're currently on can lead\r\nto it or not. But we can, for example, solve Sudoku using backtracking. We can\r\nknow immediately if our solution so far is invalid by testing if two of the same\r\nnumber appear in the same row, column, or square.\r\n\r\nLet's go through several examples of problems that can be nicely solved with\r\nbacktracking to drill this concept down.\r\n\r\n1. THE N QUEENS PUZZLE\r\nThe N queens puzzle is the classic backtracking problem. The question is this:\r\n\r\nYou have an N by N board. Write a function that returns the number of possible\r\narrangements of the board where N queens can be placed on the board without\r\nthreatening each other, i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or\r\ndiagonal.\r\n\r\nBefore continuing, you should take some time to try to solve it on your own!\r\n\r\nFirst off, let's describe the brute force solution to this problem, which means\r\ntrying every single combination of N queens in each of N * N spots. That's n2 \r\nchoose n, which is painfully slow. We can immediately improve the runtime of\r\nthis algorithm by noticing that there's no point in ever placing two queens on\r\nthe same row (or column), so we really only need to have one queen per row. Now,\r\nusing brute force, we need to iterate over each row and over each spot on each\r\nrow. Since we have N rows and N columns, our runtime will be O(NN). That's still\r\nhella slow, though.\r\n\r\nIt's helpful to ask ourselves three questions to determine whether we can apply\r\nbacktracking to a problem.\r\n\r\nCAN WE CONSTRUCT A PARTIAL SOLUTION?\r\nYes, we can tentatively place queens on the board.\r\n\r\nCAN WE VERIFY IF THE PARTIAL SOLUTION IS INVALID?\r\nYes, we can check a solution is invalid if two queens threaten each other. To\r\nspeed this up, we can assume that all queens already placed so far do not\r\nthreaten each other, so we only need to check if the last queen we added attacks\r\nany other queen.\r\n\r\nCAN WE VERIFY IF THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETE?\r\nYes, we know a solution is complete if all N queens have been placed.\r\n\r\nNow that we are confident that we can use backtracking, let's apply it to this\r\nproblem. We'll loop through the first row and try placing a queen in column\r\n0..N, and then the second, and so on up until N. What differs here from brute\r\nforce is that we'll be adding the queens incrementally instead of all at once.\r\n\r\nWe'll create an is_valid function that will check the board on each incremental\r\naddition. is_valid will look at the last queen placed and see if any other queen\r\ncan threaten it. If so, then we prune the branch since there's no point pursuing\r\nit. Otherwise, we'll recursively call ourselves with the new incremental\r\nsolution. We only stop once we hit the base case: we've placed all queens on the\r\nboard already.\r\n\r\nWe can represent our board as just a 1D array of integers from 1..N, where the\r\nvalue at the index i that represents the column the queen on row i is on. Since\r\nwe're working incrementally, we don't even need to have the whole board\r\ninitialized. We can just append and pop as we go down the stack.\r\n\r\nHere's the actual code in Python:\r\n\r\ndef n_queens(n, board=[]):\r\n    if n == len(board):\r\n        return 1\r\n\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for col in range(n):\r\n        board.append(col)\r\n        if is_valid(board):\r\n            count += n_queens(n, board)\r\n        board.pop()\r\n    return count\r\n\r\ndef is_valid(board):\r\n    current_queen_row, current_queen_col = len(board) - 1, board[-1]\r\n    # Check if any queens can attack the last queen.\r\n    for row, col in enumerate(board[:-1]):\r\n        diff = abs(current_queen_col - col)\r\n        if diff == 0 or diff == current_queen_row - row:\r\n            return False\r\n    return True\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's try it out.\r\n\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n    print(n_queens(i))\r\n1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n0\r\n2\r\n10\r\n4\r\n40\r\n92\r\n352\r\n\r\n\r\nLooks correct, according to OEIS [https://oeis.org/A000170]!\r\n\r\n2. FLIGHT ITINERARY PROBLEM\r\nThe flight itinerary problem is as follows:\r\n\r\nGiven an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as\r\n(origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport, compute the person's\r\nitinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. All flights must be used in\r\nthe itinerary.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following list of flights:\r\n\r\n * HNL ➔ AKL\r\n * YUL ➔ ORD\r\n * ORD ➔ SFO\r\n * SFO ➔ HNL\r\n\r\nand starting airport YUL, you should return YUL ➔ ORD ➔ SFO ➔ HNL ➔ AKL. (This\r\nalso happens to be the actual itinerary for the trip I'm about to take.)\r\n\r\nYou should take some time to try to solve it on your own! Notice that a greedy\r\nsolution won't work, since it's possible to have a cycle in the graph.\r\n\r\nLet's again describe the brute force solution to this problem, which is to try\r\nevery permutation of flights and verify that it's a valid itinerary. That would\r\nbe O(n!). Now let's ask ourselves if we can improve this with backtracking.\r\n\r\nCAN WE CONSTRUCT A PARTIAL SOLUTION?\r\nYes, we can build an (incomplete) itinerary and extend it by adding more flights\r\nto the end.\r\n\r\nCAN WE VERIFY IF THE PARTIAL SOLUTION IS INVALID?\r\nYes, we can check a solution is invalid if 1) there are no flights leaving from\r\nour last destination and 2) there are still flights remaining that can be taken.\r\nSince we must use all flights, this means we're at a dead end.\r\n\r\nCAN WE VERIFY IF THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETE?\r\nYes, we can check if a solution is complete if our itinerary uses all the\r\nflights.\r\n\r\nLet's use this to construct our solution:\r\n\r\ndef get_itinerary(flights, current_itinerary):\r\n    # If we've used up all the flights, we're done\r\n    if not flights:\r\n        return current_itinerary\r\n    last_stop = current_itinerary[-1]\r\n    for i, (origin, destination) in enumerate(flights):\r\n        # Make a copy of flights without the current one to mark it as used\r\n        flights_minus_current = flights[:i] + flights[i + 1:]\r\n        current_itinerary.append(destination)\r\n        if origin == last_stop:\r\n            return get_itinerary(flights_minus_current, current_itinerary)\r\n        current_itinerary.pop()\r\n    return None\r\n\r\n\r\n3. SUDOKU\r\nHere's the problem: solve a well-posed sudoku puzzle.\r\n\r\nLet's try using backtracking:\r\n\r\nCAN WE CONSTRUCT A PARTIAL SOLUTION?\r\nYes, we can fill in some portions of the board.\r\n\r\nCAN WE VERIFY IF THE PARTIAL SOLUTION IS INVALID?\r\nYes, we can check that the board is valid so far if there are no rows, columns,\r\nor squares that contain the same digit.\r\n\r\nCAN WE VERIFY IF THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETE?\r\nYes, the solution is complete when the board has been filled up.\r\n\r\nLet's try to solve it using our template. We'll try filling each empty cell one\r\nby one, and backtrack once we hit an invalid state. That'll look something like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nEMPTY = 0\r\n\r\ndef sudoku(board):\r\n    if is_complete(board):\r\n        return board\r\n\r\n    r, c = find_first_empty(board)\r\n    # set r, c to a val from 1 to 9\r\n    for i in range(1, 10):\r\n        board[r][c] = i\r\n        if valid_so_far(board):\r\n            result = sudoku(board)\r\n            if is_complete(result):\r\n                return result\r\n        board[r][c] = EMPTY\r\n    return board\r\n\r\ndef is_complete(board):\r\n    return all(all(val is not EMPTY for val in row) for row in board)\r\n\r\ndef find_first_empty(board):\r\n    for i, row in enumerate(board):\r\n        for j, val in enumerate(row):\r\n            if val == EMPTY:\r\n                return i, j\r\n    return False\r\n\r\ndef valid_so_far(board):\r\n    if not rows_valid(board):\r\n        return False\r\n    if not cols_valid(board):\r\n        return False\r\n    if not blocks_valid(board):\r\n        return False\r\n    return True\r\n\r\ndef rows_valid(board):\r\n    for row in board:\r\n        if duplicates(row):\r\n            return False\r\n    return True\r\n\r\ndef cols_valid(board):\r\n    for j in range(len(board[0])):\r\n        if duplicates([board[i][j] for i in range(len(board))]):\r\n            return False\r\n    return True\r\n\r\ndef blocks_valid(board):\r\n    for i in range(0, 9, 3):\r\n        for j in range(0, 9, 3):\r\n            block = []\r\n            for k in range(3):\r\n                for l in range(3):\r\n                    block.append(board[i + k][j + l])\r\n            if duplicates(block):\r\n                return False\r\n    return True\r\n\r\ndef duplicates(arr):\r\n    c = {}\r\n    for val in arr:\r\n        if val in c and val is not EMPTY:\r\n            return True\r\n        c[val] = True\r\n    return False\r\n\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\nMarc\r\n\r\nIf you liked this guide, feel free to forward it along!

Tree questions are very common at top tech company interviews. I had\r\ntwo tree questions in my Google onsite interviews and one during my Facebook\r\nonsite interviews. An awesome thing about them is that they can be formulaically\r\nsolved every single time. It doesn’t involve any genius insight. Let me show you\r\nhow.\r\n\r\nInstead of being too abstract, let’s just dive right into an easy binary tree\r\nquestion. Then I’ll walk through how to solve it and we can go into a harder\r\nproblem after:\r\n\r\n> Given the root to a binary tree, count the total number of nodes there are.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we move on further, feel free to take a moment to think about the answer!\r\n\r\nSolving any binary tree question involves just two steps.\r\n\r\nFirst is solving the base case. This usually means solving the leaf node case (a\r\nleaf node has no left or right children) or the null case. For the above\r\nproblem, we can see that a null should represent 0 nodes while a leaf node\r\nshould represent 1 node.\r\n\r\nSecond is the recursive step. Assuming you knew the solution to the left subtree\r\nand the right subtree, how could you combine the two results to give you the\r\nfinal solution? It’s important to not get caught up on how this works and just\r\nhave faith that it works. If you start tracing the recursion, you’re going to\r\nneedlessly use up time and energy during the interview. Intuitively though, it\r\nworks for similar reasons as why regular induction works. P(0) or the base case\r\nworks which causes P(1) or the leaf node to work which causes P(2) to work and\r\nso on. For this problem, it’s easy to combine the results of the left and right\r\nsubtrees. Just add the two numbers and then another 1 for the root. Here’s the\r\ncode:\r\n\r\ndef count(node):\r\n  return count(node.left) + count(node.right) + 1 if node else 0\r\n\r\n\r\nYou certainly won’t get a question this easy but the process is the same for\r\ntrickier problems. Here’s another problem:\r\n\r\n> Given the root to a binary tree, return the deepest node.\r\n\r\n\r\nBase case for this question actually can’t be null, because it’s not a real\r\nresult that can be combined (null is not a node). Here we should use the leaf\r\nnode as the base case and return itself.\r\n\r\nThe recursive step for this problem is a little bit different because we can’t\r\nactually use the results of the left and right subtrees directly. So we need to\r\nask, what other information do we need to solve this question? It turns out if\r\nwe tagged with each subresult node their depths, we could get the final solution\r\nby picking the higher depth leaf and then incrementing it:\r\n\r\ndef deepest(node):\r\n    if node and not node.left and not node.right:\r\n        return (node, 1) # Leaf and its depth\r\n\r\n    if not node.left: # Then the deepest node is on the right subtree\r\n        return increment_depth(deepest(node.right))\r\n    elif not node.right: # Then the deepest node is on the left subtree\r\n        return increment_depth(deepest(node.left))\r\n\r\n    return increment_depth(\r\n            max(deepest(node.left), deepest(node.right),\r\n                    key=lambda x: x[1])) # Pick higher depth tuple and then increment its depth\r\n\r\ndef increment_depth(node_depth_tuple):\r\n    node, depth = node_depth_tuple\r\n    return (node, depth + 1)\r\n\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\nMarc\r\n\r\nIf you liked this guide, feel free to forward it along!

Let's work through the problem of\r\nuniformly picking a random element from a gigantic stream. This is a common\r\ninterview question at companies like Google and Facebook.\r\n\r\nNaively, we could process the stream and store all the elements we encounter in\r\na list, find its size, and pick a random element from [0, size - 1]. The problem\r\nwith this approach is that it would take O(N) space for a large N.\r\n\r\nInstead, let's attempt to solve using loop invariants. On the ith iteration of\r\nour loop to pick a random element, let's assume we already picked an element\r\nuniformly from [0, i - 1]. In order to maintain the loop invariant, we would\r\nneed to pick the ith element as the new random element at 1 / (i + 1) chance.\r\nFor the base case where i = 0, let's say the random element is the first one.\r\nThen we know it works because\r\n\r\n * For i = 0, we would've picked uniformly from [0, 0].\r\n * For i > 0, before the loop began, any element K in [0, i - 1] had 1 / i \r\n   chance of being chosen as the random element. We want K to have 1 / (i + 1) \r\n   chance of being chosen after the iteration.

I wrote a tutorial on how to solve hard interview\r\nquestions and thought you might be interested.\r\n\r\nSo let's go over the thought process for solving tricky coding interview\r\nquestions. I often find it's not enough to just be able to solve the problem;\r\nyou really need to vocalize your thought process. This shows that you're a\r\nstrong communicator and that you didn't just get lucky solving this one\r\nparticular problem.\r\n\r\nThe question we'll work through is the following: return a new sorted merged\r\nlist from K sorted lists, each with size N. Before we move on any further, you\r\nshould take some time to think about the solution!\r\n\r\n 1. First, go through an example. This buys time, makes sure you understand the\r\n    problem, and lets you gain some intuition for the problem. For example, if\r\n    we had [[10, 15, 30], [12, 15, 20], [17, 20, 32]], the result should be [10,\r\n    12, 15, 15, 17, 20, 20, 30, 32].\r\n    \r\n    \r\n 2. Next, give any solution you can think of (even if it's brute force). It\r\n    seems obvious that if we just flattened the lists and sorted it, we would\r\n    get the answer we want. The time complexity for that would be O(KN log KN),\r\n    since we have K * N total elements.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n 3. The third step is to think of pseudocode—a high-level solution for the\r\n    problem. This is where we explore different solutions. The things we are\r\n    looking for are better space/time complexities but also the difficulty of\r\n    the implementation. You should be able to finish the solution in 30 minutes.\r\n    Here, we can see that we only need to look at K elements in each of the\r\n    lists to find the smallest element initially. Heaps are great for finding\r\n    the smallest element. Let's say the smallest element is E. Once we get E, we\r\n    know we're interested in only the next element of the list that held E. Then\r\n    we'd extract out the second smallest element and etc. The time complexity\r\n    for this would be O(KN log K), since we remove and append to the heap K * N \r\n    times.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n 4. Initialize the heap. In Python this this is just a list. We need K tuples.\r\n    One for the index for which list among the list of lists the element lives;\r\n    one for the element index which is where the element lives; and the value of\r\n    the element. Since we want the key of the heap to be based on the value of\r\n    the element, we should put that first in the tuple.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n 5. While the heap is not empty we need to: * Extract the minimum element from\r\n       the heap: (value, list index, element index)\r\n     * If the element index is not at the\r\n       last index, add the next tuple in the list index.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n4. Write the actual code. Ideally, at this point, it should be clear how the\r\ncode should look like. Here's one example:\r\n\r\ndef merge(lists):\r\n    merged_list = []\r\n\r\n    heap = [(lst[0], i, 0) for i, lst in enumerate(lists) if lst]\r\n    heapq.heapify(heap)\r\n\r\n    while heap:\r\n        val, list_ind, element_ind = heapq.heappop(heap)\r\n\r\n        merged_list.append(val)\r\n\r\n        if element_ind + 1 < len(lists[list_ind]):\r\n            next_tuple = (lists[list_ind][element_ind + 1],\r\n                          list_ind,\r\n                          element_ind + 1)\r\n            heapq.heappush(heap, next_tuple)\r\n    return merged_list\r\n\r\n\r\n 5. Think of test cases and run them through your interviewer. This shows that\r\n    you're willing to test your code and ensure it's robust. I like to think of\r\n    happy cases and edge cases. Our original example would be a happy case. Edge\r\n    cases might be.\r\n    \r\n     * lists is [].\r\n     * lists only contains empty lists: [[], [], []].\r\n     * lists contains empty lists and non-empty lists: [[], [1], [1,2]].\r\n     * lists contains one list with one element: [[1]].\r\n     * lists contains lists of varying size: [[1], [1, 3, 5], [1, 10, 20, 30,\r\n       40]].\r\n    \r\n    \r\n 6. Finally, the interviewer should ask some follow-up questions. One common\r\n    question is: what other solutions are there? There's actually another\r\n    relatively simple solution that would use a divide-and-conquer strategy. We\r\n    could recursively merge each half of the lists and then combine the two\r\n    lists. This would have the same asymptotic complexities but would require\r\n    more \"real\" memory and time.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\nDoing all these steps will definitely help you crystallize your thought process,\r\ngrasp the problem better, and show that you are a strong communicator and help\r\nyou land that job offer!\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\nMarc\r\n\r\nIf you liked this guide, feel free to forward it along!

In other\r\nwords, when we get a key at a time, it should return the value that was set for\r\nthat key set at the most recent time.\r\n\r\nConsider the following examples:\r\n\r\nd.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0\r\nd.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2\r\nd.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1\r\nd.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2\r\n\r\n\r\nd.set(1, 1, 5) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 5\r\nd.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be null\r\nd.get(1, 10) # get key 1 at time 10 should be 1\r\n\r\n\r\nd.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0\r\nd.set(1, 2, 0) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 0\r\nd.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be 2"},{"sl":98,"level":"Easy","question":"Good morning!
